Based on a transdisciplinary endeavor among construction science, urban planning & landscape architecture, civil engineering, computer science, and public health, the goals of this work are to: (1) create a DTC model that quantifies older adults' collective distress and associated environmental conditions; and (2) leverage the DTC model to develop and evaluate technological and environmental interventions to alleviate older adults' distress while walking, which can lead to promoting their independent mobility and health. This research is conducted in collaboration with local stakeholders and older adults in an underserved neighborhood in Houston, TX, Magnolia Park-Manchester. This paper will discuss the experimental design, community engagement activities, and tentative design of interventions driven by convergent insights obtained from data analysis and community feedback to improve mobility of older adults in the urban environment.","","978-1-6654-9227-0","10.1109/DTPI55838.2022.9998907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9998907","Healthy aging;digital twin city;underserved communities;physiological data;wearable sensors;distress;environmental interventions;technological interventions","Data analysis;Smart cities;Computational modeling;Urban planning;Data models;Digital twins;Stakeholders","data analysis;digital twins;geriatrics;health care;town and country planning;wearable sensors","capturing walkability distress;civil engineering;community engagement activities;computer science;construction science;data analysis;digital twin city model;DTC model;elderly adults;environmental interventions;landscape architecture;mobile phones;public health;technological interventions;urban planning;wearable sensor devices","","","","4","IEEE","3 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Integrating Human Mobility and Infrastructure Design in Digital Twin to Improve Equity and Resilience of Cities","C.

Building equity and resilience for cities to cope with disaster impacts it in an urgent need. Cities are composed of the built environment that shapes humans' mobility and capabilities to survive in disasters. Hence, integrating human mobility and infrastructure design may hold the key to building equity and resilience for our cities. However, a methodological framework is missing to analyze the interdependencies and interactions between human mobility and infrastructure systems to inform the design of equitable and resilient urban spaces. Here, we summarize our studies on characterizing complex urban environments, modeling human-infrastructure interactions, and proposing an optimal scenario that improves equity and resilience of population accessibility to infrastructures. Our work has broad implications for the integration of humans and infrastructure in digital space through smart city digital twins. We finally propose a design of the digital space to connect the societal challenges of equity and resilience with the technological innovations in the digital twin.","","978-1-6654-9227-0","10.1109/DTPI55838.2022.9998905","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9998905","Human mobility;Equity;Resilience;Data-driven models;Infrastructure planning and design","Technological innovation;Smart cities;Shape;Urban areas;Buildings;Sociology;Digital twins","digital twins;graphical user interfaces;human computer interaction;human factors;smart cities","complex urban environments;digital space;digital twin;disaster impacts;disasters;environmental stresses;equitable spaces;global cities;human mobility integration;human-infrastructure interactions;infrastructure design;infrastructure systems;methodological framework;resilient urban spaces;shapes humans;smart city;smart city digital twins;technological innovations","","1","","5","IEEE","3 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Construction-oriented digital twin technology can improve the efficiency and safety of site management. Designing a construction-oriented digital twin system is a complex process, requiring the design of the modules that implement the digital twin to ensure system viability. Furthermore, it is necessary to design system functions and interactions according to user needs to ensure the humanization of the system. This paper starts from these two aspects, theoretically builds the construction-oriented digital twin module, preliminarily designs the system prototype, and experimentally tests its usability. The innovations of this paper include the following points: 1. Combine digital twin technology with infrastructure construction safety management; 2.

In this paper, we propose a novel digital twin-enabled reinforcement learning approach and apply it to an autonomous driving scenario. To further improve the data efficiency of reinforcement learning, which often requires a large amount of agent-environment interactions during the training process, we propose a digital-twin environment model that can predict the transition dynamics of the physical driving scene. Moreover, we propose a rollout prediction-compatible reinforcement learning framework, which is able to further improve the training efficiency. The proposed framework is validated in an autonomous driving task with a focus on lateral motion control. The simulation results illustrate that our method could significantly speed up the learning process and the resulting driving policy could achieve better performance, compared to the conventional reinforcement learning approach, which demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed digital-twin-enabled reinforcement learning method.","","978-1-6654-3337-2","10.1109/DTPI52967.2021.9540179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9540179","Reinforcement learning;environment digital twin model;end-to-end control;autonomous driving","Training;Digital twin;Simulation;Reinforcement learning;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Real-time systems","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;motion control","end-to-end autonomous driving;digital twin maps;physical plant;real-time digital representation;facilities product design;decision-making processes;digital twin-enabled reinforcement learning approach;autonomous driving scenario;data efficiency;agent-environment interactions;training process;digital-twin environment model;physical driving scene;rollout prediction-compatible reinforcement learning framework;autonomous driving task;learning process;driving policy;conventional reinforcement learning approach;reinforcement learning method","","2","","16","IEEE","22 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, although various studies have introduced the concepts and roles of the digital twin system and the digital things, more research is still needed on the specific concept on how to efficiently operate/manage them.
