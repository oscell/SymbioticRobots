Furthermore, the protective film is often attached to touch films and cover glasses for their safety. However, relatively few researches have been done for those products and there are many issues when we use current inspection system for multi-layered thin films. In this paper, we propose the novel method to inspect them based on 3d surface reconstruction. We use line profiles of each layer which composes the multi-layered thin film. Also an enhanced light source system is applied to inspect user specified layers by using the patterned retarder. Also we propose the robust defect analysis system by using user specified depth images. We made 3d inspection platform which shows very stable results regarding defects detection among layers. Finally, our study is applied to the commercial system which is used for visual inspection of the film.","","978-1-4673-6752-3","10.1109/ISOT.2014.69","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7119433","Film inspection;glass inspection;multi-layered film inspection;multi-layered translucent film inspection;thee-dimensional film reconstruction","Inspection;Three-dimensional displays;Image reconstruction;Vibrations;Optical imaging;Optical films","inspection;light sources;optical glass;optical multilayers;optical retarders;surface reconstruction","line profiles;light source system;user specified layers;patterned retarder;robust defect analysis system;user specified depth images;3d inspection platform;defects detection;visual inspection;cover glasses;touch films;protective film;display product;3D surface reconstruction;multilayered thin film inspection","","","","5","IEEE","11 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Depending on the sensitivity & throughput requirements, a chip fabrication plant mixes and matches the inline inspection strategies to ensure early detection of defects on the chip, which could cause yield loss or reliability problems. This paper discusses the use of a novel concept of high sensitivity & high throughput inspection strategy using the 29xx tool. This is achieved by using a unique combination of Broad-Band light with Dark Field Apertures. This application can be used to monitor and screen a large number of wafers affected by out of control situations. A use-case is also discussed where optically strong defect locations uniquely seen on 29xx tool were found to be invisible after SEM review. After analyzing defects using see-through imaging on Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), along with Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) of the defect locations, those defects were confirmed to be buried defects inside the current layer. Due to low sampling on inspection tools, it was difficult to determine the quantity of wafers affected by the issue. By using high throughput (TPT) 29xx features, a methodology to screen out a high volume of wafers at high throughput was implemented & used to monitor the variability in the process and identify wafers at risk. This methodology enabled inspection of ~15 wafers per hour. The same methodology was subsequently successfully implemented to verify/monitor multiple excursion scenarios at different process steps.","2376-6697","978-1-5090-0270-2","10.1109/ASMC.2016.7491124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7491124","CFM: Contamination Free Manufacturing;DI;Defect Inspection and Reduction","Monitoring;Inspection;Apertures;Throughput;Broadband communication;Sensitivity;Imaging","design for manufacture;inspection;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit yield;process monitoring;scanning electron microscopy;transmission electron microscopy","nontraditional inspection strategy;inline monitoring;defect inspection;patterned wafer inspection;chip fabrication plant;inline inspection strategy;chip defect detection;reliability problems;yield loss;high throughput inspection strategy;high sensitivity inspection strategy;29xx inspection tool;broadband light;dark field apertures;SEM review;see-through imaging;scanning electron microscope;transmission electron microscope;TEM;design rule manufacturing","","4","","3","IEEE","16 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper mainly analyzes the impact of the inspection and replacement technology of escalator and its related components on the safe operation of escalator, and draws the corresponding conclusions. By investigating the inspection and replacement technology of the step, step shaft and step roller in the process of escalator maintenance, the influence on the failure of escalator is analyzed. Study found that at the same time, based on the existing technology, should also increase the step support structure detection method and the service life of the requirements, increase the step operation level and the straightness of the requirements of the steprequirement extremum chain extension of the content, to increase the service life of the roller requirements in order to reduce the probability of the accident. Through the analysis of the normal operating conditions of escalator, it is found that the load on the upper curve part of the passenger carrying branch of escalator is the largest, so the inspection and replacement frequency of the upper curve part of the passenger carrying branch of escalator should be strengthened to prevent the damage of the ladder due to the longtime of high load operation. It has important guiding significance to improve the maintenance level of escalator and the safety of escalator operation.","","978-1-6654-1540-8","10.1109/ICBAIE52039.2021.9389966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9389966","step;steproller;inspection;replacement;passenger branch","Shafts;Time-frequency analysis;Inspection;Maintenance engineering;Safety;Internet of Things;Escalators","escalators;inspection;maintenance engineering;rollers (machinery);shafts","escalator operation;safe operation;inspection technology;replacement technology;escalator maintenance;step support structure detection method;step operation level;step shaft;step roller;service life;extremum chain extension;passenger carrying branch;maintenance level","","","","12","IEEE","2 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Magnetic flux leakage (MFL) testing is currently the most widely used inline inspection method for oil and gas steel pipelines, which can realize the identification, quantification and positioning of pipeline metal loss and other defects. MFL testing is equivalent testing. Eliminating noise in MFL signal plays a vital role in correctly extracting information from signal and realizing correct defect identification. In this paper, a wavelet de-noising method of MFL signal based on alternating coefficient is proposed. The method uses signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), root mean square error (RMSE), smoothness, for comprehensive evaluation. Combined with the time consumption, the appropriate wavelet denoising parameters are selected. The application of engineering inspection data shows that the method has a good application effect.","","978-1-6654-7548-8","10.1109/ICARCE55724.2022.10046475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10046475","Magnetic flux leakage (MFL) testing;In-line Inspection(ILI);Wavelet denoising;Alternating coefficient;Parameter selection component","Magnetic flux leakage;Oils;Noise reduction;Pipelines;Inspection;Wavelet analysis;Indexes","inspection;magnetic flux;magnetic leakage;mean square error methods;nondestructive testing;pipelines;signal denoising;steel;wavelet transforms","alternating coefficient;appropriate wavelet denoising parameters;correctly extracting information;engineering inspection data;equivalent testing;gas pipeline;gas steel pipelines;important national energy infrastructure;lifeline project;magnetic flux leakage testing;MFL signal;MFL testing;pipeline magnetic flux leakage in-line inspection;pipeline metal loss;realizing correct defect identification;signal-to-noise ratio;wavelet de-noising method analysis;widely used inline inspection method","","","","8","IEEE","22 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
