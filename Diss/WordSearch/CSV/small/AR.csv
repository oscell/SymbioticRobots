Deploying stationary infrastructural cameras within indoor environments for the purpose of Augmented Reality could provide a users' devices with additional functionality that a small device and mobile sensors cannot provide to its user. Therefore people tracking could be expected to become an ubiquitously available infrastructural element in buildings since surveillance cameras are widely used. The use for scenarios indoors or close to buildings is obvious. We present and discuss several different ways where people tracking in real-time could influence the fields of Augmented Reality and further vision based applications.","","978-1-4244-5390-0","10.1109/ISMAR.2009.5336452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336452","Augmented Reality;People Tracking;Sensor Fusion","Augmented reality;Cameras;Surveillance;Sensor fusion;Global Positioning System;Target tracking;Particle filters;Image analysis;Sensor systems;Fuses","augmented reality;cameras;computer vision;sensor fusion;surveillance;tracking;ubiquitous computing","vision based people tracking;ubiquitous augmented reality;surveillance;human behavior estimation;stationary infrastructural cameras;mobile sensors;sensor fusion","","8","1","7","IEEE","17 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is different from the traditional augmented reality. The traditional virtual reality, mixed reality and augmented reality are all generated for humans, i.e., they are human-centered frameworks. On the contrary, the proposed inverse augmented reality is a virtual agent-centered framework, which represents and analyzes the reality from a virtual agent's perspective. In this paper, we elaborate the framework of inverse augmented reality to argue the equivalence of the virtual world and the physical world regarding the whole physical structure.","","978-1-5386-7592-2","10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct.2018.00056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8699316","augmented reality;inverse;virtual agent","Augmented reality;Physics;Virtual environments;Evolution (biology);Augmented virtuality;Mathematical model","augmented reality;human computer interaction;multi-agent systems","inverse augmented reality;virtual agent-centered framework;virtual world;virtual objects;traditional augmented reality;traditional virtual reality;mixed reality;IAR;human-centered frameworks","","12","","13","IEEE","29 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The procedure of validating the model is called ""discrepancy check"". The system proposed here allows the user to easily obtain an augmentation in order to find differences between the planned 3D model and the built items. The main difference to previous body of work in this field is the emphasis on usability and acceptance of the solution. While standard image-based solutions use markers or rely on a ""perfect"" 3D model to find the pose of the camera, our software uses anchor-plates. Anchor-Plates are rectangular structures installed on walls and ceiling in the majority of industrial edifices. We are using them as landmarks because they are the most reliable components often used as reference coordinates by constructors. Furthermore, for real industrial applications, they are the most suitable solutions in terms of general applicability. Unfortunately, they have not been designed with computer vision applications in mind. On the contrary, they are often made or painted in such way that they are not easily popping out. They are therefore difficult targets to segment and to track. This paper proposes a solution to extract and match them to their 3D counterparts. We created a software that uses the detected structures for pose estimation and image augmentation. The software has been successfully employed to find discrepancies in several rooms of two industrial plants.","","978-1-4244-1749-0","10.1109/ISMAR.2007.4538834","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4538834","H.5.1 [Multimedia Information Systems];H.5.2 [User Interfaces];I.4.6 [Segmentation];I.4.9 [Applications]","Augmented reality;Application software;Construction industry;Usability;Software standards;Cameras;Computer vision;Image segmentation;Target tracking;Industrial plants","augmented reality;CAD;computer vision;construction industry;production engineering computing","industrial augmented reality solution;discrepancy check;CAD software;construction companies;anchor-plates;computer vision","","26","7","18","IEEE","6 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system uses a depth camera to track the pose of a user standing in front of a large display. A volume visualization of a CT dataset is augmented onto the user, creating the illusion that the user can look into his body. Using gestures, different slices from the CT and a photographic dataset can be selected for visualization. In addition, the system can show 3D models of organs, text information and images about anatomy. For interaction with this data we present a new interaction metaphor that makes use of the depth camera. The visibility of hands and body is modified based on the distance to a virtual interaction plane. This helps the user to understand the spatial relations between his body and the virtual interaction plane.","2375-5334","978-1-4673-1246-2","10.1109/VR.2012.6180909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6180909","H.5.1 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Artificial, augmented, and virtual realities","Visualization;Glass;Computed tomography;Mirrors;Cameras;Augmented reality;Education","augmented reality;biomedical education;cameras;computer aided instruction;computerised tomography;data visualisation","mirracle;anatomy education;augmented reality magic mirror system;depth camera;pose tracking;large display;volume visualization;CT dataset;CT slices;photographic dataset;3D models;organs;text information;interaction metaphor","","114","","8","IEEE","12 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
