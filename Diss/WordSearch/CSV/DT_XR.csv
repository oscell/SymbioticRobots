The term digital twin refers to a virtual representation of a real-world environment. DTs are known for providing intuitive, accurate, and real-time visualizations of complex physical systems. In this paper, we present a novel, cloud-based framework for creating digital twin environments using VR within a cloud environment. We demonstrate our framework with two real-world case studies inspired by clinical insights obtained from experts in post-stroke rehabilitation. In the case of rehabilitation, sessions within virtual scenarios mimicking patients’ everyday life may significantly improve their rehabilitation quality. Inspired by biofeedback, we used a digital twin in VR to allow patients to enhance hand stability using real-time data streaming. Our second case study demonstrated the utility of our approach for allowing patients to more comfortably navigate within their homes by generating a virtual twin of an apartment. Our work is designed to transcend the boundary between reality and virtuality by letting users interact directly with the real and virtual worlds simultaneously. To achieve real-time synchronization between the real and the virtual environments, we established an infrastructure blueprint that features efficient sensor data collection, streaming, processing, and storage in a secure cloud environment. Data may then be accessed from any site, directly from the cloud, to update the virtual environment. In the end, we show that our infrastructure is generalizable across clinically-relevant tasks. We hope to extend our work to other areas that would benefit from a digital twin-based VR space.","","978-1-6654-8755-9","10.1109/ICIR55739.2022.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10070914","digital twin;virtual reality;post-stroke rehabilitation;Internet of Things;cloud services;Microsoft Azure","Cloud computing;Software libraries;Virtual environments;Data visualization;Real-time systems;Stability analysis;Digital twins","cloud computing;digital twins;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","cloud-based framework;complex physical systems;digital twin environments;digital twin-based VR space;Digital Twins;DTs;interactive digital twin;novel cloud framework;patients;post-stroke rehabilitation;real worlds;real-time data;real-time synchronization;real-time visualizations;real-world case studies;rehabilitation quality;secure cloud environment;significant popularity;term digital twin;virtual environment;Virtual Reality;virtual representation;virtual scenarios;virtual twin;virtual worlds;virtuality","","","","17","IEEE","23 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Together with NORCE, the Norwegian Research Centre, a setup has been developed and deployed physically in the Φ-Lab in 2018, based on the GeoViz software, which allows navigating a full 3D globe of the Earth and even flying to other planets/satellites (e.g. the Moon). Users are free to choose which locations to explore and, for each of those locations, which EO images/products to examine (Sentinel-2 band combinations, Sentinel-3 scenes and Sentinel-1-derived products such as interferograms, coherence, intensity). GeoViz is also able to display 3D models (e.g. of spacecraft, buildings), point clouds (e.g. of cities, sites, inSAR showing soil subsidence), laser scans (e.g. of plantations) and even hyperspectral data. More recently, the hype around Digital Twins, and particularly the ESA Digital Twin Urban Pilot (DTUP) project, led to the generation of highly-detailed 3D model reconstructions of sites of interest (namely the ESA/ESRIN site and the city of Frascati), surveyed using drones. Using these 3D models partly as direct inputs, partly as inspiration, a second permanent VR/XR installation was developed and deployed in the lab in 2021. This installation leverages the Unity game engine development platform, to produce an early extended reality (XR) precursor of a digital twin of the ESRIN campus. The ESRIN 3D model is integrated, through the Unity application, with real-time environmental data sensed in-situ by two different kinds of specialized device existing in ESRIN, one measuring air quality (PM25, PM10, CO2, NO2, NH3, CO, etc.) and one measuring vegetation health (NDVI, evapotranspiration, chlorophyl, etc.). The complete augmented model can then be explored using virtual reality headsets. Future plans include the implementation of an Augmented Reality experience using an Android mobile phone App, which would allow users present on-site to walk around and use their phone cameras for the augmented visualization and interaction experience.","","978-1-6654-8574-6","10.1109/MetroXRAINE54828.2022.9967539","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9967539","virtual reality;augmented reality;mixed reality;earth observation;satellite data;3D models;digital twin","Earth;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Extended reality;Atmospheric modeling;Urban areas;Data visualization","data visualisation;virtual reality","Augmented Reality experience;augmented visualization;complete augmented model;Digital Twins;early extended reality precursor;Earth Observation use-cases;EO space;ESA Digital Twin Urban Pilot project;ESA Phi-Lab;ESRIN 3D model;European Space Agency's Phi-Lab;GeoViz software;highly-detailed 3D model reconstructions;hyperspectral data;interaction experience;multisource data visualization;NH3;Norwegian Research Centre;real-time environmental data;Sentinel-1-derived products;Sentinel-2 band combinations;Sentinel-3 scenes;Unity game engine development platform;virtual reality headsets","","","","10","IEEE","5 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, due to lockdown and physical proximity restrictions imposed by policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the employment of these laboratory modes has been quickly increasing.

These applications will have diverse performance requirements (e.g., user-defined quality of experience metrics, latency, and reliability) which will be challenging to be fulfilled by existing wireless systems. To meet the diverse requirements of the emerging applications, the concept of digital twins has been recently proposed. A digital twin uses a virtual representation along with security-related technologies (e.g., blockchain), communication technologies (e.g., 6G), computing technologies (e.g., edge computing), and machine learning, so as to enable the smart applications. In this tutorial, we present a comprehensive overview on digital twins for wireless systems. First, we present the fundamental concepts (i.e., design aspects, high-level architecture, and frameworks) of digital twins for wireless systems. Second, a comprehensive taxonomy is devised for two aspects, namely, twins for wireless and wireless for twins. For the twins for wireless aspect, we consider issues related to design of twin objects, physical devices, and interface, as well as prototyping, deployment trends, incentive mechanism, isolation of twins, and decoupling. For the wireless for twins aspect, we consider issues related to accessing twin objects, security and privacy, and air interface design are considered.

Due to limited instrument access and lack of visualization techniques, understanding its principles can be challenging. Digital twin technology allows the creation of virtual representations of physical systems, which can be particularly useful to address challenges in AFM education. To realistically simulate nanoscale physics, we first developed new efficient algorithms for four virtual scale models, including cantilever mechanics, probe transducers, controller tuning, and contact mechanics. Second, three simulated experiment interactive learning modules are developed for instrument operation, including virtual imaging, system overview, and imaging modalities. In the end, three hardware systems are integrated for an extended reality experience, including a macroscopic AFM scale model, a haptic device for probe-sample interaction force feedback, and an upgraded low-cost educational AFM for nanoscale imaging and instrumentation. This completes the eight total modules for the AFM SMILER: A scale model interactive learning extended reality toolkit. Preliminary studies show the toolkit being helpful for AFM education.

The deployment of emerging technologies allows O&G companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets. Considering DT adoption, the O&G industry is still at an early stage with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology, the current status of O&G-related DT research activities, and the opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the O&G industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the context of the O&G industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study. These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. From this literature review, it was found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle management are the key application areas of digital twin in the O&G industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT related research in the O&G industry, the United States (US) is the leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China, Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The overall publication rate was less than ten articles (approximately) per year until 2017, and a significant increase occurred in 2018 and 2019. The number of journal publications was noticeably lower than the number of conference publications, and the majority of the publications presented theoretical concepts rather than the industrial implementations. Both these observations suggest that the DT implementation in the O&G industry is still at an early stage.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2998723","Petroleum Research Newfoundland and Labrador (PRNL); Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA); Mitacs; University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy; Memorial University of Newfoundland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9104682","Digitalization;digital twin (DT);industry 4.0;extended reality;industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);oil and gas","Industries;Digital twin;Data models;Bibliographies;Oils;Market research;Companies","gas industry;production engineering computing;text analysis","digital twin;oil and gas industry;digital technologies;O&G-related DT research activities;literature review;industrial publications;DT deployment;DT related research;industrial implementations;keyword-based publication search;scientific databases;Elsevier;IEEE Xplore;OnePetro;Scopus;Springer;online text analytic software;Voyant Tools;Norway;United Kingdom;Canada;United States;China;Italy;Netherland;Brazil;Germany;Saudi Arabia","","109","","174","CCBY","1 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The developed contact-based mid-air virtual tap and word-gesture (swipe) keyboard provide established support functions for text correction, word suggestions, capitalization, and punctuation. A user evaluation with 64 participants revealed that XR displays and input techniques strongly affect text entry performance, while subjective measures are only influenced by the input techniques. We found significantly higher usability and user experience ratings for tap keyboards compared to swipe keyboards in both VR and VST AR. Task load was also lower for tap keyboards. In terms of performance, both input techniques were significantly faster in VR than in VST AR. Further, the tap keyboard was significantly faster than the swipe keyboard in VR. Participants showed a significant learning effect with only ten sentences typed per condition. Our results are consistent with previous work in VR and optical see-through (OST) AR, but additionally provide novel insights into usability and performance of the selected text input techniques for VST AR. The significant differences in subjective and objective measures emphasize the importance of specific evaluations for each possible combination of input techniques and XR displays to provide reusable, reliable, and high-quality text input solutions.

Accordingly, this study contributes to a digital twin-based security framework for industrial control systems, extending its capabilities for simulation of attacks and defense mechanisms. Four types of process-aware attack scenarios are implemented on a standalone open-source digital twin of an industrial filling plant: command injection, network Denial of Service (DoS), calculated measurement modification, and naive measurement modification. A stacked ensemble classifier is proposed as the real-time intrusion detection, based on the offline evaluation of eight supervised machine learning algorithms. The designed stacked model outperforms previous methods in terms of F1Score and accuracy, by combining the predictions of various algorithms, while it can detect and classify intrusions in near real-time (0.1 seconds).

The aim of a Digital Twin is to support all stakeholders during the whole lifecycle of such system or object. One of the core aspects of a Digital Twin is modeling and simulation, which is a well-established process, e.g., in the development of systems.

All these technologies fall under the Extended Reality (XR) spectrum. Areas in which XR technologies and, in particular, immersive experiences have been successfully introduced are expanding daily, from traditional areas, such as entertainment and video game production, to novel scenarios, such as industry, healthcare, smart cities, and autonomous vehicles, to mention a few. The spread of XR and VR is also driven by technological advancements that are making new ways of operating within virtual experiences easier, and sometimes even possible. In particular, the availability of new hardware and software tools make the use of “3D reconstructions”, “digital twins” and “simulations” commonplace in many XR and VR applications. For example, the possibility to leverage networks with higher bandwidth than never before and lower latency makes it possible to transmit the amount of data needed for massive, real-time digital twins, whereas high-performance hardware enables the reconstruction of high-fidelity digital objects and environments, while lowering the time needed for high-demanding simulations. The aim of the 3D Reconstruction, Digital Twinning, and Simulation for Virtual Experiences (ReDigiTS) workshop is to bring together researchers, practitioners, educators, and students to share ideas and promote further work in this growing area of 3D reconstruction, digital twinning, and simulation in VR and related technologies.","","979-8-3503-4839-2","10.1109/VRW58643.2023.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10108626","","Solid modeling;Video games;Three-dimensional displays;Smart cities;Conferences;User interfaces;Hardware","","","","","","0","IEEE","1 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Each virtual subworld, operated by a virtual service provider (VSP), provides a type of virtual service. Digital twins (DTs), namely, digital replicas of physical objects, are key enablers. Generally, a DT belongs to the party that develops it and establishes the communication link between the two worlds. However, in an interoperable metaverse, data-like DTs can be “shared” within the platform. Therefore, one set of DTs can be leveraged by multiple VSPs. As the quality of the shared DTs may not always be satisfying, in this article, we propose an agile solution, i.e., a dynamic hierarchical framework, in which a group of Internet of Things devices in the lower level are incentivized to collectively sense physical objects’ status information and VSPs in the upper level determine synchronization intensities to maximize their payoffs. We adopt an evolutionary game approach to model the devices VSP selections and a simultaneous differential game to model the optimal synchronization intensity control problem. We further extend it as a Stackelberg differential game by considering some VSPs to be first movers. We provide open-loop solutions based on the control theory for both formulations. We theoretically and experimentally show the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the equilibrium to the lower level game and further provide a sensitivity analysis for various system parameters.

There are also many “grey” areas between and beyond these realities, making it desirable to embrace an overarching vision. Throughout the world, many, including us, have chosen to use the framework of extended reality (XR) as a unifying concept to interpolate between the realities and to eXtrapolate beyond them. Together with XR, there is also XI (extended intelligence) for which the IEEE has convened the Council on eXtended Intelligence (CXI). A related concept is the metaverse, i.e. shared VR, introduced in 1974 as “metavision” and “metaveillance” and recently popularized by industry. In this paper we propose eXtended meta-uni-omni-Verse (XV) as an overarching term, concept, and taxonomy for shared (social) XR across all of the “verses”, including the universe (physical reality, i.e. atoms), the metaverse (virtuality, i.e. bits), the omniverse and multiverse, etc. We also briefly outline the state-of-the-art in the various realities and verses covered by XV.

The blockchain technology augmented with AI promises to deliver a trusted metaverse for everyone. Nevertheless, smart contracts fail to produce a cognitive prediction, dissuading users from confiding in the metaverse. We arm smart contracts with intelligence to predict using AI algorithms. Moreover, we deploy the smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain platform and produce a prediction accuracy of 95% compared to Python scikit-learn-based predictions. Our results show that the prediction delay can obstruct the growth of metaverse applications to accept blockchain technologies.

Such services (e.g., digital twins, extended reality or cooperative robots) will require highly reliable and deterministic communication networks capable of supporting stringent latency and reliability requirements. 5G networks and their future evolution have the necessary capabilities to meet these requirements. However, the use of 5G in industrial environments requires its effective and efficient integration with Time Sensitive Networking (TSN), which is becoming the standard wired technology for Industry 4.0 environments. TSN provides unprecedented deterministic service levels with perfectly bounded latencies. The integration of the industrial 5G and TSN networks will be key to support the flexibility and determinism demanded by the Industry 4.0 paradigm. A critical aspect to achieve this integration is the coordination of the schedulers of both networks. TSN has information about the capabilities of the 5G-TSN integrated network, and it is in charge of deciding the path and scheduling for each TSN traffic flow. The scheduling in 5G must be done according to the scheduling decisions and information provided by TSN to guarantee the end-to-end latency requirements of TSN traffic. In this context, this paper proposes a novel Configured Grant (CG) scheduling scheme for 5G integrated into a TSN network that aims to meet the latency requirements of the different TSN flows. The proposed scheme exploits the information provided by TSN about the characteristics of the TSN traffic to coordinate its decision with the scheduling of TSN. This study demonstrates that the proposed scheduling scheme considerably increases the number of TSN flows that can be satisfactorily served in the integrated 5G-TSN network compared with a commonly used CG scheduling scheme.","","978-3-903176-56-0","10.23919/WONS57325.2023.10062219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062219","5G;5G-TSN integration;Deterministic;Low Latency;TSN;Configured Grant;scheduling;Industry 4.0","Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Job shop scheduling;5G mobile communication;Service robots;Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems","5G mobile communication;cyber-physical systems;digital twins;manufacturing systems;production engineering computing;scheduling;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic","5G configured grant scheduling;5G-TSN integrated network;5G-TSN integration;deterministic communication networks;digitalized data-based ecosystems;effective integration;highly reliable communication networks;industrial environments;industrial services;integrated 5G-TSN network;reliability requirements;time sensitive networking;TSN flows;TSN traffic flow;unprecedented deterministic service levels","","1","","24","","13 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The disparity in transmitted object dimension (2D as opposed to 3D) leads to asymmetric data sizes in uplink (UL) and downlink (DL). To ensure the reliability and low latency of the system, we consider an asynchronous joint UL-DL scenario where in the UL stage, the smaller data size of the physical world images captured by multiple extended reality users (XUs) will be uploaded to the Metaverse Console (MC) to be construed and rendered. In the DL stage, the larger-size 3D virtual objects need to be transmitted back to the XUs. We design a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm structure, namely Asynchronous Actors Hybrid Critic (AAHC), to optimize the decisions pertaining to computation offloading and channel assignment in the UL stage and optimize the DL transmission power in the DL stage.

Such requirements can be sustained with 5G networks and their evolution that offer unprecedented communications performance and flexibility thanks to the softwarization of networks and the use of network slicing. Network slicing creates different logical partitions or slices of the common network infrastructure and configures each slice to the requirements of the applications it will support. RAN (Radio Access Network) slicing is a fundamental part of network slicing in 5G as the radio channel is prone to errors and this impacts the capacity to support stringent reliability requirements. To date, RAN slices have been created considering the number of radio resources that must be reserved to guarantee the transmission rate or bandwidth demanded by the applications they will serve. This study demonstrates that this design approach cannot guarantee satisfying the reliability requirements of industrial applications and proposes a novel RAN slice descriptor that takes into account both the reliability and transmission rate requirements of the applications.","","978-1-6654-9996-5","10.1109/ETFA52439.2022.9921528","Generalitat Valenciana; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921528","5G;RAN slicing;Beyond 5G;Industry 4.0;slice creation;slice design;reliability;deterministic;non-deterministic","5G mobile communication;Shape;Service robots;Network slicing;Bandwidth;Production;Reliability engineering","5G mobile communication;Internet;military communication;protocols;quality of service;radio access networks;telecommunication security","5G RAN slicing;industrial applications;communication networks;evolution that offer unprecedented communications performance;flexibility thanks;network slicing;different logical partitions;common network infrastructure;Radio Access Network;stringent reliability requirements;RAN slices;novel RAN slice descriptor;transmission rate requirements","","","","13","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With distinctive features of immersive experience, simultaneous interactivity, and user agency, the Metaverse has the capability to transform all walks of life. However, the enabling technologies of the Metaverse, i.e., digital twin, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and extended reality, are known to be energy-hungry, therefore raising concerns about the sustainability of its large-scale deployment and development. This article proposes Green Metaverse Networking for the first time to optimize energy efficiencies of all network components for Metaverse sustainable development. We first analyze energy consumption, efficiency, and sustainability of energy-intensive technologies in the Metaverse. Next, focusing on computation and networking, we present major advancements related to energy efficiency and their integration into the Metaverse. A case study of energy conservation by incorporating semantic communication and stochastic resource allocation in the Metaverse is presented. Finally, we outline the critical challenges of Metaverse sustainable development, thereby indicating potential directions of future research towards the green Metaverse.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.130.2200510","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10012292","","Metaverse;Artificial intelligence;Data centers;Measurement;Sustainable development;Energy consumption;Computational modeling","","","","","","","IEEE","9 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Then, the techniques, edge computing, edge caching, and edge intelligence will be more widely utilized for intelligent local data storage and processing generated by 6G applications, while innovative access network architecture based on the cloud-edge servers, such as the Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) will be adopted to improve the flexibility and openness for new service deployment and frequent network changes. On the other hand, new attack surfaces and vectors targeting local infrastructure and users will emerge along with the deployment of novel network architecture and techniques. Massive researchers have studied the potential security and privacy threats on the 6G network edge as well as the countermeasures. The three techniques, edge computing, edge caching, and edge intelligence have become a double-edged sword that can not only be synchronously utilized to develop defense countermeasures, but also become the targets of many new security and privacy threats. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of articles on the three techniques-related security threats and countermeasures on the 6G network edge. We explain how security and privacy can be destroyed by attacking one of the three technologies and how the three services support each other to realize efficient and achievable security protection. Moreover, the researches on the benefits and limitations of Federated Learning (FL) and blockchain for decentralized edge network systems in terms of security and privacy are also investigated. Additionally, we also analyze the existing challenges and future directions towards 6G.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2023.3244674","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3104200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62202386); 2022 Suzhou Innovation and Entrepreneurship Leading Talents Program (Young Innovative Leading Talents)(grant numbers:ZXL2022458); Basic Research Programs of Taicang(grant numbers:TC2021JC31,TC2022JC22); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:D5000210817); Xi’an Unmanned System Security and Intelligent Communications ISTC Center; Special Funds for Central Universities Construction of World-Class Universities (Disciplines) and Special Development Guidance(grant numbers:0639022GH0202237,0639022SH0201237); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10044183","Security;privacy;edge intelligence;edge computing;edge caching;6G","Security;Privacy;6G mobile communication;Servers;Edge computing;Artificial intelligence;Image edge detection;Surveys","6G mobile communication;blockchains;cloud computing;computer crime;computer network security;data privacy;edge computing;learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks","6G network edge;attack surfaces;blockchain;cloud-edge servers;decentralized edge network systems;defense countermeasures;edge caching;edge computing;edge intelligence;federated learning;FL;innovative access network architecture;intelligent local data storage;O-RAN;open-radio access network;privacy threats;security protection;service deployment;service requirements;techniques-related security threats","","1","","218","IEEE","14 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, much attention has been paid to its entertainment and social functions. Considering the openness and interoperability of metaverses, the market of quality inspection promises explosive growth. In this paper, taking advantage of metaverses, we first propose the concept of Automated Quality Inspection (AutoQI), which performs integrated inspection covering the entire manufacturing process, including Quality of Materials, Quality of Manufacturing (QoM), Quality of Products, Quality of Processes (QoP), Quality of Systems, and Quality of Services (QoS). Based on the scenarios engineering theory, we discuss how to perform interactions between metaverses and the physical world for virtual design instruction and physical validation feedback. Then we introduce a bottomup inspection device development workflow with productivity tools offered by metaverses, making development more effective and efficient than ever. As the core of quality inspection, we propose Quality Transformers to complete detection task, while federated learning is integrated to regulate data sharing. In summary, we point out the development directions of quality inspection under metaverse tide.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2022.106091","Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province(grant numbers:2021402011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9970440","Automated Optical Inspection;Metaverses;Quality Inspection;Transformers","","automatic optical inspection;inspection;manufacturing processes;open systems;production engineering computing;quality control;quality of service;virtual reality","Automated Quality Inspection;bottomup inspection device development;entire manufacturing process;integrated inspection;metaverse tide;metaverses;QoM;QoP;QoS;Quality Transformers","","6","","31","","5 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
