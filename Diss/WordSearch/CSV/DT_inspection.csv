This has become a significant concern for the safety and security of the semiconductor industry. Physical inspection techniques have been used to validate the IC hardware integrity and detect security threats to address these concerns. However, most physical inspection methods for ICs rely upon removing unwanted epoxy packaging material without damaging the device under test (DUT). Therefore, the precise removal of the IC packaging guided by knowledge of the packaging structure is very important for efficiency and accuracy in this process. Currently, IC structure analysis depends on using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT), which is time-consuming and lacks the spatial resolution necessary for characterizing advanced heterogeneous packages. For hardware assurance purposes, the entire volume of a device must be analyzed with high efficacy. Additionally, various packaging and the recently adopted 2.5D and 3D advanced packages bring more challenges to meet assurance requirements. Hybrid metrology, which is the combined use of inspection methods for characterization, has the potential to address the inspection challenges for advanced packaging. In this paper, a novel hybridized inspection method utilizing nondestructive THz time-domain spectrum (THz-TDS) and X-ray CT of the IC package is used to create a digital twin (DT) of the sample. The combined characterization can be leveraged to improve the efficiency and accuracy for high quality sample preparation. Hybrid inspection paired with automated sample preparation can reduce the time and operator input needed for complete verification of a large volume of samples. In this paper, the method of generating a digital twin of the IC internal regions of interest (ROI) will be introduced. Analysis of the generated digital twin is used to optimize the material removal necessary for IC verification without damaging the ROI. This inspection and removal methodology can be automated using boundary conditions from the design information of the IC package. Hybrid inspection provides the high spatial resolution thickness and geometry information for generating an automated material removal routine. This provides access to the sample’s ROI for further FIB plasma delayering and SEM verification.","1946-1550","978-1-6654-3988-6","10.1109/IPFA53173.2021.9617431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9617431","sample preparation;hardware assurance;physical inspection;digital twin;THz;X-ray tomography","Integrated circuits;Digital twin;Computed tomography;Inspection;Packaging;Hardware;Integrated circuit packaging","computerised tomography;failure analysis;inspection;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit packaging;integrated circuit reliability;integrated circuit testing;nondestructive testing;probes;semiconductor industry;three-dimensional integrated circuits","ic packaging structure analysis;malicious hardware security threats;physical inspection techniques;IC hardware integrity;physical inspection methods;IC structure analysis;high-resolution X-ray computed tomography;heterogeneous packages;hardware assurance purposes;IC package;high quality sample preparation;hybrid inspection;automated sample preparation;IC internal regions;IC verification;high spatial resolution thickness;hybridized inspection method;epoxy packaging material;nondestructive THz time-domain spectrum;X-ray CT;digital twin aided IC packaging structure analysis;IC internal region of interest;ROI;boundary conditions","","1","","21","IEEE","29 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Digital Twin process workflow is proposed in case of Mohammed VI Bridge modeling in Morocco. The current maintenance of a road infrastructure is based on a manual inspection and a system based on traditional tools. Aging infrastructures require a new approach to maintenance in terms of inspection, bridge maintenance system, simulation and systematic evaluation. This system now exists and is called the Digital Twin. Digital Twin can be thought of as a virtual prototype in service that changes dynamically in near real time as its physical twin changes. An urban infrastructure digital twin is a virtual instance of his physical twin that is continuously updated with multisource, multisensor and multitemporal data that can be used for monitoring, simulating and forecasting any potential problem that may appear in the structure and proposing planning for repair and maintenance of health status throughout the life cycle of this infrastructure. This work presents a general vision and a justification for integrating DT technology with geospatial data. The paper examines the benefits of integrating 3D GIS data acquired by automated mobile mapping (MMS) workflows for modeling the reality of a major bridge infrastructure in Morocco. This allowed to study the future performance of this bridge structure on virtual twin structures under different environmental conditions. Cloud point data are acquired by a Mobile Mapping System on Mohammed VI Bridge and converted in BIM model by a scan to BIM process and is integrated in a GIS and BIM virtual environment and shows the efficiency of volumetric auscultation in terms of surface flatness and distortion inspection.

To optimize the operation of the conveyor system, range-inspection control (RIC) has been considered an efficient strategy to bring this conventional technology to an intelligent level. Various algorithms have been put into use to achieve optimal control. However, the current methodologies are only focusing on control optimization, not scaled into the smart manufacturing framework. The schema of alignment and corporation between the physical and virtual spaces for the system remains an important problem. Therefore, the work in this article aims for an effective framework of implementation between the physical and virtual stations in an automated conveyor system. Since increasingly more application scenarios rely on the digital twin (DT) technology to realize the integration of physical and virtual systems, we proposed the DT automated conveyor system (DT-ACS) that constructs the road map to implement the RIC-based conveyor system under the background of a smart factory. Besides, profit-sharing-based deep Q-networks (PDQNs) have been proposed to cope with the RIC optimization problem. The robustness and efficiency of the proposed PDQN were evaluated via sets of experiments. The discussion and conclusion are presented at last accordingly. Note to Practitioners—This article aims to propose a strategy of control optimization for conveyor-based manufacturing systems under the digital twin (DT) framework. The conveyor system can be flexible to control the running flows to avoid overloading workstations. Due to the complex environment in the production line, the range that is able to be inspected and the capacity of the reserve area can be considerably diverse among the workstations. To maximally evaluate our framework, we set a comparatively complex environment for the experiments. Nevertheless, to obtain practically ideal performance under other circumstances, the parameters should be precisely tested and fine-tuned with simulation in advance.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2020.3043393","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972016,62032016); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L191007,JQ19011); Beijing Science and Technology Major Project(grant numbers:Z191100002719004); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:YWF-20-BJ-J-612); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9303438","Conveyor system;deep Q-networks;digital twin (DT);profit sharing;range-inspection control (RIC)","Workstations;Digital twin;Smart manufacturing;Wireless sensor networks;Radiofrequency identification;Prognostics and health management;Manipulators","conveyors;factory automation;inspection;manufacturing systems;optimal control;optimisation","smart manufacturing framework;physical systems;virtual systems;DT automated conveyor system;profit-sharing-based deep Q-networks;RIC optimization problem;conveyor-based manufacturing systems;adaptive optimization method;digital twin conveyor systems;range-inspection control;optimal control","","7","","46","IEEE","22 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Better knowledge of the system behavior increases the availability of the plant and the possibility to predict potential faults during operation.This paper presents two examples of digital twins. The first one, which is realized for a 50MW electric drive train, is designed to identify the actual unbalance state of the rotor system. The second one is designed to optimize the run up routines for synchronous motors with DOL start. It calculates the current rotor temperature based on the transferred losses and predicts the temperature for switching-on scenarios.The mathematical methods to implement digital twins are explained in detail.

While ensuring safety and the possibility of losses of components and waste of material are against their usage. Furthermore, developments in design of virtual environments makes it possible to perform simulations in a virtual environment, to enable human-in-the-loop production of parts correctly the first time like never before. Such powerful simulation and control software provides the means to design a digital twin of manufacturing environment in which trials are completed at almost at no cost. In this paper, ant colony optimization is used to program an industrial robot to avoid obstacles and find its way to pick and place objects during an assembly task in an environment containing obstacles that must be avoided. The optimization is completed in a digital twin environment first and movements transferred to the real robot after human inspection.

For instance, detecting early symptoms of cyber attacks may speed up the incident response process and mitigate consequences of attacks (e.g., business interruption, safety hazards). However, attaining a full understanding of the cyber situation may be challenging, given the complexity of CPSs and the ever-changing threat landscape. In particular, CPSs typically need to be continuously operational, may be sensitive to active scanning, and often provide only limited in-depth analysis capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose to utilize the concept of digital twins for enhancing cyber situational awareness. Digital twins, i.e., virtual replicas of systems, can run in parallel to their physical counterparts and allow deep inspection of their behavior without the risk of disrupting operational technology services. This paper reports our work in progress to develop a cyber situational awareness framework based on digital twins that provides a profound, holistic, and current view on the cyber situation that CPSs are in.

The digital twin (DT) is an innovative technology recently developed in Industry 4.0 to provide a virtual representation of physical components, products, or equipment such as computer numerical control (CNC) machines. It can be used to run simulations before manufacturing. However, traditional DT platforms lack data privacy, traceability, immutability, authentication of stakeholders. Moreover, manual prediction of the wearing of the tool condition of the CNC machine is challenging. Motivated from these gaps, in this paper, we propose a six-layered architecture for DT of CNC, which predicts CNC tool wear detection using a novel ensemble technique based soft voted prediction model consisting of XGBoost, random forest, and AdaBoost models. The proposed architecture also incorporates the public Ethereum blockchain (BC) to maintain the aforementioned issues of authentication, traceability, and transparency through constraints and automation programmed into the smart contracts (SC) developed. We evaluate the proposed scheme’s performance through simulation and compare it with other traditional approaches concerning several performance parameters (accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall). The result shows that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional approaches on these same performance parameters such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-7122-7","10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9500498","Digital Twin;Artificial Intelligence;Ensemble Learning;Blockchain;Smart Contract;CNC;Industry 4.0","Authentication;Computer architecture;Predictive models;Tools;Prediction algorithms;Classification algorithms;Blockchains","blockchains;computerised numerical control;condition monitoring;data privacy;inspection;Internet of Things;machine tools;manufacturing systems;production engineering computing;random forests;wear","performance parameters;digital twin-based prediction;CNC machines inspection;IIoT;virtual representation;computer numerical control machines;data privacy;traceability;CNC tool wear detection;ensemble technique;soft voted prediction model;random forest;AdaBoost models;public Ethereum blockchain;DT platforms;Industry 4.0;quality of services;industrial Internet of Things;tool condition wearing prediction;six-layered architecture;XGBoost;smart contracts;F1-score;precision;recall;authentication","","4","","21","IEEE","6 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A UAV DTs information forecasting model is constructed based on improved AlexNet, whose performance is analyzed through simulation experiments.

Hardware-in-the-loop setups are routinely used by manufacturing companies to carry out virtual commissioning. However, manufacturing companies having online legacy production systems are still struggling to incorporate a digital twin due to the absence of verified and validated simulation models. Companies that use virtual commissioning as a part of their engineering tool chain, usually perform offline verification of the simulation model. This approach is typically based on visual inspection and is a tedious task as each aspect of the model has to be visually validated. For legacy systems, only assessing the behavior visually in the absence of updated documents can result in an incorrect simulation model, i.e. simulating incorrect behavior with respect to the specification. Due to this, such simulation models cannot be incorporated in the engineering tool chain, as the simulated results can lead to improper decisions and can even cause equipment damage. This paper presents a platform and an approach, based on model-based testing, that is a first step for manufacturing companies to incorporate a validated simulation model for existing online production systems that will serve as a digital twin.","2161-8089","978-1-5386-3593-3","10.1109/COASE.2018.8560338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8560338","","Production systems;Visualization;Digital twin;Virtual environments;Companies;Aging;Tools","control engineering computing;digital simulation;inspection;production engineering computing;simulation languages","legacy systems;incorrect simulation model;engineering tool chain;model-based testing;manufacturing companies;validated simulation model;online production systems;digital twin;simulation model testing;hardware-in-the-loop setups;virtual commissioning;online legacy production systems;verified simulation models;validated simulation models","","22","","21","IEEE","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Energy measurements from smart meters represent hourly mean power, while voltage measurements are instantaneous with uneven time intervals. Thus, measurements are not synchronous, which poses a major challenge for grid analysis. The proposed method focuses on daily mean, minimum, and maximum voltage and results show that deviations in daily minimum voltage are the most useful ones.

No longer isolated MBSE tools can suffice without a flexible infrastructure to support model integration, tool interoperability, experimentation, and data collection. This recognition provides the impetus for developing a MBSE research testbed for prototyping and evaluating aerospace systems and system-of-systems. This paper presents progress made and lessons learned in the development of a MBSE research testbed for experimentation with aerospace systems such as multi-UAV swarms. Multi-UAV swarms are used in a variety of missions ranging from search and rescue and perimeter security of high value physical assets to emergency response and infrastructure inspection. These operations are characterized by adaptive coordination, ability to survive systemic malfunctions and unexpected external disruptions, ability to discern and reach safe states when attempting to cope with unknown disruptions, ability to course correct and continuously adapt in partially observable, reactive environments. This paper discusses the implementation of digital twin-enabled MBSE testbed which employs a smart dashboard to support experimentation with dynamic scenario execution, monitoring, visualization and control.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-7436-5","10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438439","","Analytical models;Tools;Inspection;Aerospace testing;Emergency services;Distance measurement;Data models","aerospace computing;autonomous aerial vehicles;control engineering computing;inspection;mobile robots;open systems;security of data;software engineering","multiUAV swarms;MBSE research;model integration;MBSE tools;model based systems engineering;system-of-systems;aerospace systems;support experimentation;digital twin-enabled MBSE testbed","","2","","13","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pipelines will inevitably confront various risk factors throughout their lifespan, which could lead to defects. Defects in pipelines can compromise the integrity of the pipeline systems and may result in catastrophic accidents. Thus, it is vital to conduct the integrity assessment of pipelines so that the safe operation of the pipelines can be ensured. Up to the present, widely used approaches for pipeline integrity assessment include defect characterization, growth rate prediction, and failure pressure evaluation. Although the theoretical developments of pipeline integrity assessment methods have yielded fruitful achievements and significantly benefitted industry practices, there is still a lack of a systematic review covering the whole process from data collection to model establishment of the pipeline integrity assessment. Therefore, a comprehensive review is conducted in this article on the pipeline defect integrity assessment from the data modeling perspective. First, the description of data required to construct pipeline defect integrity assessment models is presented, where the required data for modeling can be obtained from pipeline inspection measurements, monitoring sensors, testing experiments, etc. Then, different modeling techniques applied to pipeline integrity assessment are reviewed, which are classified into physics-based models, data-driven models, and multimodel fusion. Also, the advantages and limitations of these techniques are discussed. Finally, the possibility of applying the existing models to a digital twin of pipeline defect is explored. This article aims to provide a guideline for researchers to select optimal models according to data availability and research requirements, which can benefit the research community, as well as, the industry.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2023.3279910","Collaborative Research Funding from the National Research Council of Canada’s Canada–Germany 3+2 Joint Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10141639","Data modeling;defect characterization;failure pressure;growth rate prediction;pipeline integrity assessment","Pipelines;Data models;Inspection;Corrosion;Feature extraction;Predictive models;Oils","accidents;data models;digital twins;inspection;oils;pipelines;reviews;risk analysis;sensors;testing","catastrophic accidents;data collection;data modeling techniques;data-driven models;digital twin;economical modes;failure pressure evaluation;monitoring sensors;multimodel fusion;oil-gas transportation;pipeline defect integrity assessment models;pipeline inspection measurements;risk factors;testing experiments","","","","155","IEEE","1 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It demonstrates a damage assessment scenario on a real aircraft component. We propose a graphical user interface that contains menu-guided instructions and inspection documentation to increase the efficiency of manual processes. Furthermore, experts located at different sites can join via a virtual session. By inspecting a 3D model of the aircraft component, they can see synchronized information from a Digital Twin database. With Augmented Reality glasses, the Microsoft HoloLens, a Digital Twin can be experienced personally. In the inspector's view, the 3D model of the Digital Twin is directly superimposed on the physical component. This Mixed Reality Vision can be used for inspection purposes. Any inspection related information can be directly attached to the component. For example, damage locations are marked by the inspector on the component's surface and are stored in the Digital Twin database. Our scenario demonstrates how new information can be derived from the combination of collected data and analyses from the Digital Twin database. This information is used to maintain the continued airworthiness of the aircraft. Feedback from domain related engineers confirm that our interface has an enormous potential for solving current maintenance problems in the aviation industry.

To achieve this long-term goal, several challenges must be overcome: among others, reliable and inlinecapable characterization methods are the key technology to deliver input and verification for the digital representative (“digital twin”). This paper gives an overview of three ultrasonic methods developed for inline characterization of copper ribbons used to interconnect solar cells in a solar module. Material parameters of these ribbons are crucial for the soldering process and the future reliability of solar modules. The three methods are based on different physical effects: 1) Determination of elastic constants by ultrasonic dispersion analysis; 2) Acoustoelastic microstructural analysis; 3) Determination of mean grain size by ultrasonic scattering analysis. Each method has its own specific range of application: Method 1 proved to be very stable and reliable for elastic constant evaluation (Young's modulus, Poison's ratio) in all areas of ribbon production and module manufacturing. Method 2 is most sensitive and suitable for detecting small changes in microstructure due to mechanical loading or manufacturing process variation. It is therefore well-suited to inline quality check in module production. Method 3 allows determination of the mean grain size, characterizing the annealing process. Mechanical loading must be avoided here, as generated dislocations also influence the attenuation. The newly developed methods and achieved results indicate enormous potential for ribbon characterization on an industrial scale and fit well in the “industry 4.0” concept.","0160-8371","978-1-5386-8529-7","10.1109/PVSC.2018.8547839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8547839","interconnectors;ribbon;module production;reliability;soldering;stress;ultrasound;process control","Stress;Acoustics;Annealing;Photovoltaic cells;Grain size;Attenuation;Dispersion","annealing;copper;elastic constants;grain size;inspection;interconnections;semiconductor device manufacture;semiconductor device reliability;solar cells;ultrasonic dispersion;ultrasonic materials testing;ultrasonic scattering;Young's modulus","copper ribbons;solar cells;ultrasonic dispersion analysis;ultrasonic scattering analysis;ribbon production;module manufacturing;manufacturing process variation;inline solar cell interconnector inspection;quality assurance;solar module reliability;acoustoelastic microstructural analysis;Youngs modulus;Poison ratio;annealing process","","","","7","IEEE","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the growing number of installations new monitoring and inspection strategies and routines need to be developed that are not only effective but efficient. In this work we will present first results from a joint project of industry partners and academia that aims at the development of new approaches making use of modern imaging technologies and new methods from artificial intelligence and computer vision research. We investigate three different strategies for collecting digital photos or video and posterior computational analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our results indicate, that patterns of interest like rust or coating damage can be detected and classified with F1 scores between 0.80 and 0.94 in photos collected by inspectors. In videos collected with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) rust patterns, oils spills and coating damage were detected with F1= 0.91. To support users in the time-consuming task of visual data exploration, we present a new visualization method referred to as “virtual twin”. Using hand - recorded image collections, a data-driven 3D model of a windmill is generated, that can be used to investigate damage patterns in the full context of the windmill and in full detail. Altogether our results indicate, that although each single approach has its limitations, a combination of different imaging methods, deep learning computer vision algorithms and sophisticated visual data exploration by experienced users appears to have potential to overcome the bottleneck in data analysis, interpretation and decision making in the context of the future inspections of offshore windmills, platforms or other constructions.","0197-7385","978-1-7281-5446-6","10.1109/IEEECONF38699.2020.9389305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9389305","Inspection;Offshore windmill;Offshore wind turbine;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles;Computer vision;Deep Learning;Artificial Intelligence","Visualization;Computer vision;Data visualization;Training data;Inspection;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Monitoring","autonomous aerial vehicles;computer vision;convolutional neural nets;data analysis;data visualisation;decision making;deep learning (artificial intelligence);inspection;offshore installations;power engineering computing;solid modelling;video signal processing","inspection strategies;routines;modern imaging technologies;artificial intelligence;digital photos;posterior computational analysis;convolutional neural networks;coating damage;unmanned aerial vehicles rust patterns;oils spills;visualization method;data-driven 3D model;damage patterns;deep learning computer vision algorithms;visual data exploration;decision making;visual monitoring;offshore windmill installations;online image annotation;offshore windmills;nuclear power plants;burning fossil resources;video analysis;data analysis","","","","10","IEEE","9 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Barriers to residential Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) autonomy as a service, include operational challenges in run-time safety compliance, reliability and resilience, due to the complexities of dealing with known and unknown risk in dynamic environments. In this paper we incorporate a Symbiotic System Of Systems Approach (SSOSA) that uses a Symbiotic Digital Architecture (SDA) to provide a cyber physical orchestration of enabling technologies. Implementing a SSOSA enables Cooperation, Collaboration and Corroboration (C3), as to address run-time verification of safety, reliability and resilience during autonomous missions. Our SDA provides a means to synchronize distributed digital models of the robot, environment and infrastructure. Through the coordinated bidirectional communication network of the SDA, the remote human operator has improved visibility and understanding of the mission profile. We evaluate our SSOSA in an asset inspection mission within a confined operating environment. Demonstrating the ability of our SSOSA to overcome safety, reliability and resilience challenges. The SDA supports lifecycle learning and co-evolution with knowledge sharing across the interconnected systems. Our results evaluate both sudden and gradual faults, as well as unknown events, that may jeopardize an autonomous mission.

Dotoli","Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, Polytechnic of Bari, Bari, Italy; Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, Polytechnic of Bari, Bari, Italy; Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, Polytechnic of Bari, Bari, Italy; Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, Polytechnic of Bari, Bari, Italy","IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","4 Jul 2022","2022","19","3","1586","1598","Deep drawing is a metalworking procedure aimed at getting a cold metal sheet plastically deformed in accordance with a pre-defined mould. Although this procedure is well-established in industry, it is still susceptible to several issues affecting the quality of the stamped metal products. In order to reduce defects of workpieces, process control approaches can be performed. Typically, process control employs simple proportional-integral-derivative (PID) regulators that steer the blank holder force (BHF) based on the error on the punch force. However, a single PID can only control single-input single-output systems and cannot handle constraints on the process variables. Differently from the state of the art, in this paper we propose a process control architecture based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), which considers a multi-variable system model. In particular, we represent the deep drawing process with a single-input multiple-output Hammerstein-Wiener model that relates the BHF with the draw-in of  $n$  different critical points around the die. This allows the avoidance of workpiece defects that are due to the abnormal sliding of the metal sheet during the forming phase. The effectiveness of the proposed process controller is shown on a real case study in a digital twin framework, where the performance achieved by the MPC-based system is analyzed in detail and compared against the results obtained through an ad-hoc defined multiple PID-based control architecture. Note to Practitioners—This work is motivated by the emerging need for the effective implementation of the zero-defect manufacturing paradigm in the Industry 4.0 framework. Especially in the deep drawing process, various quality issues in stamped parts can lead to significant product waste and manufacturing inefficiencies. This turns into considerable economic losses for companies, particularly in the automotive sector, where deep drawing is one of the most used cold sheet metal forming techniques. In most applications, only sample inspections are performed on batches of finished-product, with subsequent losses of time and resources. For the sake of improving the workpiece quality, innovative strategies for real-time process control represent a viable and promising solution. In this context, the proposed MPC-based process control approach allows the correct shaping of the metal sheet that is getting deformed during the forming stroke, thanks to the draw-in monitoring at various locations around the die. The draw-in is indeed one of the most effective forming variables to control in order to provide a correct BHF during the forming stroke. A useful and easy-to-implement non-linear metal sheet deep drawing process model is provided by this paper to perform an innovative process control strategy. A comprehensive methodology is applied in detail to an automotive case study, ranging from process modeling (model identification and validation based on experimental data acquisition) to MPC implementation (controller tuning and testing and software-in-the-loop system validation). The presented method can be easily implemented on any real deep drawing press, providing the multivariable constrained process with a suitable control system able to make the stamped parts well formed.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2022.3177362","Italian University and Research Ministry through the project Pico&Pro (National Research Program)(grant numbers:ARS01_01061); project Maia (National Research Program)(grant numbers:ARS01 00353); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61950410604); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9784854","Metal deep drawing process control;zero-defect manufacturing;real-time process control;model predictive control;software-in-the-loop simulation","Process control;Metals;Mathematical models;Force;Presses;Monitoring;Uncertainty","automobile industry;automotive components;blanking;control engineering computing;control system synthesis;deep drawing;metal stamping;metalworking;multivariable systems;predictive control;pressing;process control;production engineering computing;quality control;sheet materials;sheet metal processing;single-input single-output systems (control);three-term control","multiple PID-based control architecture;digital twin framework;simple proportional-integral-derivative regulator;stamped metal product quality;predefined mould;metalworking procedure;multivariable constrained process;deep drawing press;controller tuning;automotive case study;nonlinear metal sheet deep drawing process;draw-in monitoring;forming stroke;MPC-based process control approach;workpiece quality;cold sheet metal forming techniques;stamped parts;zero-defect manufacturing paradigm;workpiece defects;single-input multiple-output Hammerstein-Wiener model;multivariable system model;model predictive control;single-input single-output systems;BHF;blank holder force;Industry 4.0 case study","","4","","45","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, taking advantage of metaverses, we first propose the concept of Automated Quality Inspection (AutoQI), which performs integrated inspection covering the entire manufacturing process, including Quality of Materials, Quality of Manufacturing (QoM), Quality of Products, Quality of Processes (QoP), Quality of Systems, and Quality of Services (QoS). Based on the scenarios engineering theory, we discuss how to perform interactions between metaverses and the physical world for virtual design instruction and physical validation feedback. Then we introduce a bottomup inspection device development workflow with productivity tools offered by metaverses, making development more effective and efficient than ever.
